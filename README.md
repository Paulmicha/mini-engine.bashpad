Bash pad
========

Old school minimalist Bash commands store & launchpad (over SSH using PhpSeclib).  
  
This has only ever been used for local dev in LAN, and still is, for various local tests and/or older projects - mostly before the Vagrant / Docker / Ansible "era".  
Also note that this hasn't been securely tested : hosting this anywhere publicly accessible over the web is not recommended.


### Current status :
Following refactorisation of the base ("mini-engine"), which is now moved to a different repo :  
cleaning up in progress (low priority).
